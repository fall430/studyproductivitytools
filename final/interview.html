				<h2>John Doe: Organizational Mastery</h2>
                <p><img src="images/john.jpg" class="interview-pic img-left" alt="John Doe"><strong>John Doe</strong> has been a productivity coach for over a decade. He's helping clients from a wide variety of industries to streamline their workflows and enhance team collaboration. Here, he shares his most valued tool for project management.</p>
                <h3>Q: What is your favorite study or productivity tool and why?</h3>
                <p>A: Without a doubt, it's Trello. For me, the visual aspect of Trello’s boards is invaluable. You can see everything at a glance, which simplifies project management immensely. The flexibility to customize boards with tags, deadlines, and attachments means that each project can be tailored to meet specific needs.</p>
                <p>I also appreciate Trello for its collaborative features. Being able to share boards and tasks with team members and track progress in real time helps keep everyone aligned and accountable.</p>

                <h3>Q: What is your favorite study or productivity tool and why?</h3>
                <p>A: I highly recommend the Forest app. It’s brilliant for those who are easily distracted by their phone. The concept is simple yet powerful—you grow a virtual tree for as long as you avoid using your phone. This not only helps reduce interruptions but also instills a sense of accomplishment as you watch your forest expand with each focused session.</p>
                <p>What’s more, Forest partners with real-tree planting organizations, so you’re contributing to a greener planet while improving your focus. It’s a win-win!</p>

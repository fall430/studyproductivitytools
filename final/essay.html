            <h2>Building an Online Art Viewing Website with Essential Productivity Tools</h2>

            <p>In the digital realm, the fusion of art and technology opens up unprecedented avenues for creativity and accessibility. This visual essay details my journey of developing an online platform dedicated to art viewing. The website not only showcases diverse forms of art but also includes functionality for filtering and searching artworks based on different tags which help to categorize the artworks. By leveraging a combination of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, and various productivity tools, this project illustrates a comprehensive approach to building a sophisticated web application, and importantly details the various study and productivity tools used throughout the process.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Phase 1: Preparation</h3>

            <p>The initial phase of this project involved enhancing my web development skills through Udemy’s courses, primarily the ones teaching JavaScript. These sessions were crucial in understanding advanced JavaScript techniques, which are fundamental for creating an art gallery that is not only visually appealing, but also interactive.</p>

            </figure>
			<br>

            <p>Research also plays a critical role in any project. Perplexity AI helped me gather specific information on the best practices for developing art-related web platforms, including insights on user interface design tailored for art displays. It also made it easy for me to find artworks of the different varieties that I required, while ensuring that they were all reputable pieces.</p>

            <p>Evernote served as my digital notebook throughout the project. It was instrumental in organizing research findings, design ideas, and development milestones, ensuring that all facets of the project were well documented and easily accessible.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Phase 2: Execution</h3>

            <p>During the actual coding phase, Stack Overflow was invaluable for troubleshooting and refining the codebase. Community feedback and shared coding snippets helped resolve complex issues efficiently. Many of the issues I faced were already documented on Stack Overflow by other people in the past, so most of the time I only had to follow the directions given to the original poster and I would be able to continue my progress.</p>

            <p>VSCode was the chosen IDE for its extensive support for web technologies and its seamless integration with other tools. Its features were especially beneficial in handling the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML required for the art viewing website.</p>
            <figure>

			<br>

            <p>To manage the vast array of art pieces, their metadata, and user preferences, a MySQL database was integrated with the website. This backend setup enabled efficient data storage and retrieval, supporting the site’s search and filter features.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Phase 3: Correctness and Refinement</h3>

            <p>Grammarly ensured all textual content on the website, including descriptions, informational content, and interface text, was articulate and error-free. This tool was crucial in maintaining professional communication throughout the site.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
			<br>

            <p>To ensure the integrity of the website’s written content, I employed a plagiarism checker at <a href="https://plagiarismdetector.net/" target="_blank" class="journey-link">plagiarismdetector.net</a>. This tool verified the originality of all written material, ensuring that the writing content was unique and copyright compliant.</p>

			<br>

            <p>The creation of an online art viewing platform exemplifies the intersection of art, technology, and productivity. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the many study/productivity tools out there. By integrating various web technologies and productivity tools, I was able to construct a robust, user-friendly site that art enthusiasts can enjoy from anywhere in the world.</p>
